		<p>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; It doesn't look so shiny to me. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why would a robot need to drink? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
<p>Why did you bring us here? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit&hellip; that's why I'm transferring to business school! Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Shut up and take my money!</p>
<p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>
<p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I never loved you. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
