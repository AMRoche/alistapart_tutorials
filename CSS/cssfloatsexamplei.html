		<p>This is some text contained within a small-ish box. I'm using it as an example of how placing your floated elements in different orders in your HTML can affect your layouts. For example, take a look at this great photo placeholder that should be sitting on the right aligned with the text. Instead, however, because it is floated right and after this text, it jumps outside the bottom of the container, as it has no floating applied to it.

		<div style="clear: right;">Miraculously, this div with a clear:right style on it re-integrates the image in to the container by counteracting the DOM collapse.</div>
